<h1><a name="helppage">The Help Page</a></h1>

On the left hand side of the help page, there is a table of contents
which points to all sections in the help text. On the right hand side
the actual help text is located. The two frames can be resized in
relation to each other simply by pulling the line between them.

<h2>Hypertext</h2>

In the text there are references that can take you to another part of
the text. It is possible to go back and forth between the references you
have browsed using the two arrows on the left-hand side
at the bottom of the window
(just like in any other hypertext browser).

<h2><a name="help_search">Searching the Help Text</a></h2>

At the bottom of the screen an entry exists which makes it possible to
search in the help text. All matches found are shown in inversed
video. The direction of the search can be controlled by pressing the
two up and down arrows on the right-hand side of the window.  The
search is an ordinary case insensitive search.

<h2><a name="mainPage`log">Log window</a></h2> This window is used for
output of information or error messages from the Toolbox.

<h1>The Menu</h1>

This section describes all the facilities that are available in
the menu.

<h2><a name="menuline`project">Project</a></h2>
This menu contains all the functions for handling a project. A project
is a collection of specification files that belong together.

<h3><a name="project`open">Open</a></h3>

When you want to open an existing project file, a file-selection
browser will appear. The browser has the following fields:

<dl>
  <dt> Filter
  <dd> Here you can select a pattern that files should match in order to be
       seen in the file listbox. When you press enter in this entry,
       the <i>file listbox</i> will be updated, so that it matches
       this pattern.
       Alternatively, the <b>Filter</b> button can be pressed.
       It is customary that project files have the
       extension <i>.prj</i>
  <dt> Directories
  <dd> Here you can browse through your directories by
       double clicking on a directory.
  <dt> File List
  <dd> This is the list of files that matches the pattern in the
       <i>filter</i> entry. When you double click on a file, you will
       add it to the files in the project.
  <dt> Selection
  <dd> This is your current selection (if any)
</dl>
To select a file, just double click on it with the left mouse
button or press the <b>Ok</b> button. 
To cancel the open command, select the <b>Cancel</b> button.

<h3><a name="project`new">New</a></h3>

This sets the current project to be a new one. If there were any
unsaved changes to the configure of the previous one, you will be
prompted to save them. 
Select this item if you are currently working on a 
#ifdef VDMSL
VDM-SL 
#endif  //VDMSL
#ifdef VDMPP
VDM++
#endif  //VDMPP
project and you would like to start working on a new one.

<h3><a name="project`configure">Configure</a></h3>

When you select <i>Configure</i> in the <i>project</i> menu, a window
that lets you configure the current project will appear .<br>

At the top of the window you can select the files you wish to be part
of the project. This screen is divided into the following groups:

<dl>
  <dt> Filter
  <dd> Here you can select a pattern that files should match in order to be
       seen in the <i>file listbox</i>. When you press enter in this entry,
       the <i>file listbox</i> will be updated, so that it matches
       this pattern.
  <dt> Directory List
  <dd> Here you can browse through your directories by
       double clicking on a directory.
  <dt> File List
  <dd> This is the list of files that matches the pattern in the
       <i>filter</i> entry. When you double click on a file, you will
       add it to the files in the project.
  <dt> Files in the project
  <dd> This is a list of files in the current project. When you double
       click on a file, you will remove it from the project.

#endif //VDMSL

Modified options cannot be saved for the time being.

<h3><a name="option_menu_select`vdm">Interpreter Options</a></h3>

       The options here take effect whenever an expression is evaluated.
       This includes options for dynamic type checking, invariant
       checking and pre and post condition checking.
       <P>
       There is an option that enables pretty print format of values 
       produced by interpreting expressions. All values will be displayed 
       with line-breaks and indentation according to the structure of the 
       value.
       <P>
       Finally, it is possible to initialise a random number
       generator with the given integer (a seed). This causes a random order of
       evaluation of sub-statements in
       non-deterministic statement constructs. 
       A negative number will disable
       random evaluation of non-deterministic statements.

<h3><a name="option_menu_select`vdm">Type Checker Options</a></h3>
       Per default possible type checking will be used. Definite type checking 
       can also be selected here. This is likely to give a large number of 
       errors which should be considered as proof obligations. <P> It
       is also possible to get additional errors and warnings reported
       using the extended type checking option.

<h3><a name="option_menu_select`vdm">Pretty Printer Options</a></h3>
       The LaTeX and RTF pretty printers are able to produce an index 
       of all definitions automatically. <P> There is also an option 
       here which will produce a cross reference index of both defined
       and used occurrences (LaTeX only). <P> Finally, there is an option to
       incorporate test coverage information (LaTex and RTF). 

<h3><a name="option_menu_select`vdm">C++ Code Generator Options</a></h3>
       The C++ Code Generator has an option that enables the generation of
       C++ code that maintains position information. This option will slow
       down the speed of the C++ code, but it will be able to provide exact 
       information about which part of the specification the code is 
       generated from, in case a run-time error occurs.
#ifdef VDMPP
       <P>
       In addition there is an option which generate run-time checks
       of pre and post conditions for all functions and
       operations. This naturally also slows down the generated code
       but the advantage is that when a condition is violated the
       execution will be stopped immediately.
<h3><a name="option_menu_select`vdm">Java Code Generator Options</a></h3>
       The Java Code Generator has a number of options that enables 
       the generation of Java code satisfying the user's requirements.
<dl>
  <dt> Code generate only skeletons, except for types
  <dd> Specify this option to
  generate skeleton classes. A skeleton class is a 
  class containing full type, value and instance variable definitions,
  but empty function and operation definitions. 
  <dt> Code generate only types
  <dd> Specify this
  option to only want to generate Java code for VDM++ type
  definitions (i.e. functions, operations, instance variables and
  values will not be generated). 
  <dt> Code generate integers as Longs
  <dd> Using this
  option, it is possible to generate VDM++ integer values and
  variables as Java <b>Longs</b> instead of
  <b>Integers</b>.
  <dt> Code generate code with concurrency constructs
  <dd> This option is used to force the Code Generator to generate code
  which includes support for concurrency. See "The VDM++ to Java
  Code Generator" manual
  for details of this. 
  <dt> Code generate pre and post functions/operations
  <dd> Specify this option
  in order to code generate Java methods for pre and post conditions
  and invariants them. 
  <dt> Check pre and post conditions
  <dd> Specify this option to generate inline checks of function pre and post
  conditions, and operation pre conditions. Raise an exception if a
  check fails. This implies the
  previous option as pre and post conditions must be generated for
  compilable code to be generated. 
  <dt> Package
  <dd> The default behaviour of the code
  generator is to write the generated Java files in the directory,
  where your project file lies, or if no project file exists, in the
  directory, where the VDM++ Toolbox was started. The files are part
  of an unnamed default package. Specify this
  option in order to generate a specific package
  which will contain the generated Java classes. The Code Generator
  will make a new directory using the given package name containing the
  created files and the generated files will include the appropriate
  <b>package</b> statement.
  <dt> Select Interfaces
  <dd> Select classes to be generated as Java interfaces. See "The VDM++ to Java
  Code Generator" manual for details.
</dl>
#endif // VDMPP

<h3><a name="option_menu_select`interface">Interface Options</a></h3>

The interface options are grouped into two different categories:

<dl>
  <dt> External Editor
  <dd> The options here take effect whenever an external editor is invoked
       from the user interface. If the environment variable EDITOR is defined
       then the value of this variable is used as the default value of the 
       external editor name. 
  <dt> Miscellaneous
  <dd> The options here are related to the way windows should be treated
       in the interface and how to communicate with the printer.
</dl>

<h2><a name="anyPage`error_editor">The Display Window</a></h2>

This window will display the part of the specification referred to in
the errors and warnings window. A small cursor is used to identify the
exact position of the construct referred to.

<h1><a name="interptool">Interpreter Tool</a></h1>

This tool contains a dialog window for interacting with the Toolbox,
and three windows used during debug sessions: a display window, a
function trace window and a window showing breakpoints. Furthermore,
the tool has a button bar which executes debug related functions.

<h2><a name="interpPage`dialog">Dialog Window</a></h2>

This window is for entering commands for e.g., evaluation of
expressions or debugging of specifications.

<h2><a name="anyPage`debug_editor">The Display Window</a></h2>

This window will display part of the specification during debugging. A
small cursor is used to identify the exact position of the construct
referred to.

<h2><a name="interpPage`debug_trace">Function Trace</a></h2>

This window will show the function/operation call stack whenever
debugging has stopped at a breakpoint. If the textual length of the
parameters of a function/operation exceeds 70 they will be replaced by
"..."; if you click on "..." with the middle button, "..." will be
replaced by the actual parameters. Clicking on the parameters will
replace them with "...".

<h2><a name="interpPage`breakpoint">Break points</a></h2>

This window will display the function and operations currently selected 
as breakpoints whenever expressions are being debugged.

<h2>The Interpreter tool Buttons</h2>

<h3><a name="interptoolPage`init">Init</a></h3>

This button will initialise the modules in the current project.  This
includes initialising the
#ifdef VDMSL
state
#else
instance variables for the objects which has been created
#endif VDMSL
 and all values. For each 
#ifdef VDMSL
module
#else
class
#endif VDMSL
the values will be calculated in the order they appear in the source
definitions. If a value is multiply defined it will be reported during
this initialisation.

<P> If random evaluation of non-deterministic statements is enabled
(in the options menu), then the controlling random number generator is
reinitialised with the given seed.

<h3><a name="interptoolPage`step">Step</a></h3>

Executes the next statement and then break. This command will not step
into function and operation calls. The button can only be used after
the specification has been initialised and the debugger has stopped at
a breakpoint.

<h3><a name="interptoolPage`stepIn">Step In</a></h3>

Executes the next expression or statement and then break. This command
will also step into function and operation calls. This command can
only be called after the specification has been initialised and the
debugger has stopped at a breakpoint.

<h3><a name="interptoolPage`singleStep">Single Step</a></h3>

Executes the next expression or statement and then break. This command
can only be called after the specification has been initialised and
the debugger has stopped at a breakpoint.

<h3><a name="interptoolPage`continue">Continue</a></h3>

Continues the execution after a breakpoint. This command can only be
called after the specification has been initialised and the debugger
has stopped at a breakpoint.



<h3><a name="interptoolPage`finish">Finish</a></h3>

Finishes the evaluation of the current function or operation and
returns to the caller. The command is used together with 'stepin'.
This command can only be called after the specification has been
initialised and the debugger has stopped at a breakpoint.

<h3><a name="interptoolPage`up">Up</a></h3>

This command can only be called after the specification has been
initialised and the debugger has stopped at a breakpoint. It has the
effect that the current context is shifted one level up compared to
the place currently shown in the display window. Thus, the context is
changed to the place where the current function/operation was called
from in the current function trace.

<h3><a name="interptoolPage`down">Down</a></h3>

This command can only be called after the specification has been
initialised and the debugger has stopped at a breakpoint. It has the
effect that the current context is shifted one level down compared to
the place currently shown in the display window. Thus, the context is
changed down to the place where the current function/operation called
its sub-function/operation in the current function trace.

<h3><a name="interptoolPage`stopInterpreter">Stop Interpreter</a></h3>

Stop the evaluation of an expression. Access to local and global
variables depends on whether the button has been pressed within a
<b>print</b> or a <b>debug</b> command. These commands are
described below including a description of access to variables. The
command is traditionally used to break a possible infinite loop in
one's specification.

##<h1><a name="covertool">Test coverage tool</a></h1>
##
##This tool contains a display window for display of test coverage
##information. Currently the test coverage information must be collected
##using the command-line vdmde as described in the "User Manual for
##VDM-SL Toolbox", and the specification file must contain the
##\begin{rtinfo}{testsuitefile}... \end{rtinfo} section. 
##
##<h2><a name="anyPage`cover_editor">Display window</a></h2>
##
##When the button <a href="#covertoolPage`showCoverage">Show Coverage</a>

#ifdef VDMPP
<h1><a name="dependencytool">Dependency Tool</a></h1>

The dependency tool presents dependency information for a selected
class:
<dl>
  <dt> <a name="dependencyPage`dependencynamemess"> Selected Class </a>

  <dt> <a name="dependencyPage`used_by">Used by</a>
  <dd> In this window all the classes which use the selected class is
  listed.
</dl>

The information in the dependency tool are not always guaranteed to be
complete, this is indicated by a star associated to the name of the
selected class. The dependency information is complete when all
the classes are type correct.



<h1><a name="inhtreetool"><a name="inhtreePage`inhtree">Inheritance Tool</a></a></h1>


The inheritance tool gives a graphical representation of the
inheritance structure of your VDM++ specification.

<h1><a name="uml_tool`main">Rose-Link Tool</a></h1>

This window contains two sub-windows: the "Classes" window, and
the "Log" window. Furthermore, it contains a number of buttons.


<h2><a name="uml_tool`classes">The Classes Window</a></h2>

On the left-hand-side of this window each of the classes in the model
are listed with a small tick-box in front. At the right-hand-side of
this window class designators are used to describe the status of each
class. This status indicates the way in which the default mapping which is 
expected to be performed when the user chooses to carry out the mapping
between the textual VDM++ model and the graphical UML Rose
model. Between the columns indicating the class designation status
for VDM++ and UML there is a small button which is toggled when
it is pressed.


The different class designators have the following meaning:
<dl>
  <dt> A
  <dd> Indicates that the class was added since the model was last
       computed.
  <dt> ?
  <dd> Indicates that the class is not known in this model.
  <dt> M 
  <dd> Indicates that the class was modified.  
  <dt> - 
  <dd> Indicates that the class has not changed.  
  <dt> D
  <dd> Indicates that the class was deleted since the models were last
       computed.
</dl>

The action buttons can be in four different states:

<dl>
  <dt> <a name="uml_tool`left2right"><img src="bitmaps/left2right"></a>
       
  <dd> VDM++ to UML: 
       This action will map the definitions of the class defined in
       VDM++ to a class of the same name in UML. If this class exists
       in UML already it is updated. Otherwise a new class will be created.
  <dt>  <a name="uml_tool`right2left"><img src="bitmaps/right2left"></a>
       
  <dd> UML to VDM++: 
       This action will take the definitions of the class defined in   
       UML and map them to a class of the same name in VDM++. 
       Consequently this will create a new class or update the 
       definitions of an already existing VDM++ class with the same name.
  <dt>  <a name="uml_tool`both_ways"><img src="bitmaps/both_ways"></a>
        
  <dd> Merge:
       Selecting this action for a class will take the definitions 
       of the class defined in VDM++ and merge them with the 
       definitions of the class defined in UML. This may not always be
       possible. 
  <dt>  <a name="uml_tool`no_action"><img src="bitmaps/no_action"></a>
        
  <dd> Exclude:
       This will exclude the class from the new model being computed. As a   
       consequence the class will be removed from both the UML and
       VDM++ model.

<h2><a name="uml_tool`log">The Log Window</a></h2>

This window is used for
output of information or error messages from the Rose-VDM++ Link
tool. In particular the information showing the difference between the
information present about a class in the VDM++ and the UML model is
shown here when the <b>Diff</b> botton is used.

<h2><a name="uml_tool`buttons">The Rose-VDM++ Link Buttons</a></h2>

The different buttons on the Rose-VDM++ Link tool can be divided into
three categories as described below.

<h3><a name="uml_tool`selButs">Selection Buttons</a></h3>

<dl>
  <dt> <a name="uml_tool`All">All</a>
  <dd> This button selects all classes.
  <dt> <a name="uml_tool`None">None</a>
  <dd> This button deselects all classes.
</dl>

<h3><a name="uml_tool`dirButs">Direction Buttons</a></h3>

<dl>
  <dt> <a name="uml_tool`VPP2UML"><img src="bitmaps/all_right"></a>
  <dd> This button maps all classes from the VDM++ model to the UML model.
  <dt> <a name="uml_tool`UML2VPP"><img src="bitmaps/all_left"></a>
  <dd> This button maps all classes from the UML model to the VDM++ model.
  <dt> <a name="uml_tool`Default">Default</a>
  <dd> If the state of the action buttons have been changed, the
       default settings can be restored any time by clicking this button.
</dl>

<h3><a name="uml_tool`actionButs">Action Buttons</a></h3>

<dl>
  <dt> <a name="uml_tool`Diff">Diff</a>
  <dd> This button shows the differences between the VDM++ model and
       the UML model for all the selected classes.
  <dt> <a name="uml_tool`Map">Map</a>
  <dd> This button performs the actual mapping between the VDM++ and
       UML models with the directives indicated by the different
       direction buttons. 
  <dt> <a name="uml_tool`Close">Close</a>
  <dd> This button closes the Rose-VDM++ Link tool without mapping
       between the UML and VDM++ models.

<h1><a name="interpPage`icons">The icons on top of each frame</a></h1>
On top of each frame a series of icons are located. Here is a
description of what they do:
<dl>
##  <dt> <a name="icons`close"><img src="bitmaps/closeBig"></a>
##  <dd> This will close the frame, to reopen it, select it in the <a
##       href="#windows`reopen">Windows-&gt;reopen menu</a>
##  <dt> <a name="icons`moveUp"><img src="bitmaps/moveUpBig"></a>
##  <dd> This will create a top-level window outside the frame. This gives you
##       the possibility to configure the menu-page the way you want
##       it. See the section <a href="#windows`saveLayout">Save
##       layout</a> to see how to save the layout.
##  <dt> <a name="icons`moveDown"><img src="bitmaps/moveDownBig"></a>
##  <dd> This will insert a frame that has been <a
##       href="#icons`moveUp">made to a top-level</a>, into the main window.
##  <dt> <a name="icons`move"><img src="bitmaps/moveAroundBig"></a>
##  <dd> This will bring up a window with four arrows which can
##       <a href="???">rearrange the layout of the current page.
##       The current window will be moved in the direction of the arrow
##       pressed.</a>
  <dt> <a name="icons`print"><img src="bitmaps/printBig"></a>
  <dd> This will print the content of the frame to your printer. 
  <dt> <a name="icons`pipe"><img src="bitmaps/pipe"></a>
  <dd> This will pipe the content of the buffer. When you select this
       function a window will appear that asks you for a program to
       pipe to.
  <dt> <a name="icons`clear"><img src="bitmaps/clearBig"></a>
  <dd> In <a href="#interpPage`dialog">the dialog
       window</a> and <a href="#mainPage`log">the log window</a>  this
       erases the content of the window. In the <a href="#interpPage`breakpoint">breakpoint
       window</a> this deletes the marked breakpoints.
  <dt> <a name="icons`edit"><img src="bitmaps/editBig"></a>
  <dd> This will start an external editor with all the selected files, if it
       is invoked from the 
#ifdef VDMSL
modules
#else
classes
#endif // VDMSL
       window. From the display window, it
       will start an external editor with the actual windows content.
  <dt> <a name="icons`pm"><img src="bitmaps/plusminusBig"></a>
  <dd> This will toggle the state of the breakpoints. That is enable
  breakpoints which have been disabled and vice versa. Disabled breakpoints
  will be indicated with [-] in front of them.
  <dt> <a name="icons`toggleHierarchy"><img
  src="bitmaps/hier_off"></a> <br>
  <dt> <img src="bitmaps/hier_on">
  <dd> This button will toggle between a hierachical and flat view of
#ifdef VDMSL
   modules.
#else
   classes.
#endif
</dl>
