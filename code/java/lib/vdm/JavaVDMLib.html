implements the Java VDM library. The library is documented using
javadoc. Here we give some general additional information.

<P>

All the classes in Java are subclasses of the <TT> java.lang.Object</TT> class and
so are the Java classes, which implement the VDM datatypes.

All the methods which insert elements into compound data types expect
elements of type <TT>Object</TT>. However, since all classes are subclasses
of the <TT>java.lang.Object</TT> class, this is no problem. 

The type of elements returned by compound data types will always be <tt>Object</tt>. 
These objects can however be explicitly casted to the original type if necessary.

In this context, the  <tt>instanceof</tt> operator is of importance. 
Look at the following
example:
<PRE>
Object obj = St.GetElem();

if (obj instanceof Sequence)  
 {
  Sequence Sq = (Sequence)obj
  ...
 }
</PRE>
The <tt>instanceof</tt> operator returns true if the
object on the left-hand side is an instance of the class or
implements the interface on the right-hand side. Otherwise it
returns false.

<p>

We will now briefly describe, how the VDM Data Types have been
implemented in Java.


<hr>
<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME = "DTBasic">Basic VDM Data Types</A></FONT></H2>
<P>

<H3> Float, Int, Boolean, Char Types</H3>

The Java language package provides the following ``wrapper'' classes for the
primitive VDM data types  float,  int,  boolean and 
  char: Double, Integer, Boolean and Character respectively.  However, not all of
the C++ functions on VDM types found in the VDM C++ library have direct
equivalents in the Java classes.  Moreover, they can't just be added
to a subclass, because these Java classes are final.
The <tt>java.lang.Math</tt> class however does provide some of these functions, like
for example <tt>pow</tt> or <tt>exp</tt>. 

Another difference to C++ is, that Java does not allow method overloading.
The following syntax is therefore necessary:

<PRE>
C++ style: -I,  Java style: I = new Integer(-(I.intValue()))
C++ style: I1 - I2,   Java style: new Integer (I1.intValue() - I2.intValue())
</PRE>

<H3> Quote Type</H3>
A VDM Quote is not equivalent to a Java String. 
Therefore the class <tt>java.lang.String</tt> is not the right way to represent quotes.
Just imagine you misspell a quote. The Java compiler will not detect this, because it is
still a correct string.

In the current implementation of the VDM java library, the Quote class contains a private
variable holding a string.

<H3> Token Type</H3> 

The VDM token is represented by the Token class. It has a
private variable of type Object, which holds the VDM value.

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">
    <A NAME = "DTCompound">Compound VDM Data Types</A></FONT></H2>

In order to
resemble the existing VDM C++ Library as much as possible, almost all
the methods have the same name as their corresponding C++
functions. Only the First and Next functions of the Set, Map and
Sequence types have been replaced by an implementation typical for
Java.  Java typically use the Enumeration interface in order to
iterate through a set of values.
The iterator method can be used in the following way:

<PRE>
    for (Enumeration e=Sq.iterator(); e.hasMoreElements();){
      UTIL.printObject(e.nextElement());;
    }
</PRE>
<H3>Product Type</H3> 

The values of a product type are called tuples.
The class, which models the VDM Tuple Type, is called Tuple and
can be found in the file Tuple.java in the VDM package.  
A tuple is essentially an
array of fixed size. Therefore, the Tuple class has the following protected attribute:
<PRE>
Object[] t;
</PRE>
and the following constructor:
<PRE>
public Tuple(int i){
    t = new Object[i];
  }
</PRE>
 
<h3>The Composite Type</h3>

The VDM Composite Type can be represented by Java's
class mechanism. All record types defined in a VDM specification are
code generated as subclasses of the Record class found in the VDM package.  
Fields in a record become variables in the new class.

<h3>The Union Type</h3>

The VDM Union Type is supported by the Java <tt> Object</tt>. As a consequence, 
Union Type definitions are ignored by the code generator. This
has of course some disadvantages. Imagine the following type definition in VDM:

<PRE>
A = B | C
Test: () ==> A
</PRE>

The Java code will ignore the type definition and the operation Test will return an
<tt>Object</tt>. 

<h3>Optional Type</h3>

In order to support the VDM Optional Type, a Nil class has been implemented.
It  can be found in the file Nil.java in this package. The class is a subclass of
Object, but does not add any definitions.

<h3>Function Type</h3>

The VDM Function Type is not supported.

    <A NAME = "GF"></A>General functions on VDM Data Types - <a href="jp.vdmtools.VDM.UTIL.html#_top_">The UTIL class</a></FONT></H2>

The VDM C++ library provides some functions which are applicable to
instances of all types and which therefore are defined in class
Common.  As described above, the java.lang.Object class replaces the
Common class.  The functionality found in the common class has
therefore be implemented in an alternative way. The functions ascii,
equals and clone have been added to an abstract class, called UTIL.  
It is recommended to use the methods provided in the UTIL class.

<DL>
<DT>ascii
<DD>The UTIL.ascii method has to be used in order to get a string containing an ASCII representation of a VDM
value.
The ascii
method has been implemented as a static method in the class UTIL.
Moreover, the ascii method has been added to the Java classes,
which represent the VDM compound data types. It could however not be
added to the Java classes, which represent the VDM basic data types.
This is not possible because the Java wrapper classes
for the primitive data types are final.

<DT>equals <DD> The UTIL.equals method has to be used in order to
compare two VDM values.  The equals method has been implemented as a
static method in the class UTIL.  Note, that also the wrapper classes
for the primitive data types provide an equals method and that equals
methods have been added to the classes implementing compound data
types. However, in order to compare two VDM
values, use the UTIL.equals methods. 

See the below example for an
explanation: 

<PRE> 
Double d = new Double(2) 
Integer i = new Integer(2)
</PRE> 

UTIL.equals(d,i) returns true, while d.equals(i) returns false.
Therefore it is advised to use the UTIL.equals method to resemble VDM
semantics.

<DT>clone <DD> 
We have decided to let the code generator take care of the
cloning of objects. As a consequence, this library clones objects only
in some rare cases.The only method which explicitly clones is the <tt>
Tl()</tt> method. This is done in order to keep the whole sequence. The
<tt>ImpTl</tt> method on the other hand replaces the sequence with its
tail. In order to let the code generator take care of
the cloning of objects, all objects should be clonable.  Primitive
data types (Integer,Character,Double,Boolean) however can't be modified.
Therefore it is not necessary to clone them.
In C++  one writes 

<PRE>
Int b = a
b = a + 1
</PRE>

which makes cloning necessary. 

The corresponding Java code looks like:

<PRE>
Integer a = ..
Integer b = new Integer(a.intValue());
b= a.intValue() + 1;
</pre>

Thus, cloning is not necessary.

In order to clone a compound data type, use the clone method:

<PRE>
Tuple T = ...
Tuple cT = (Tuple)T.clone()
</PRE>

Use the UTIL.clone method in order to clone an "Object" of arbitrary type.

The provided clone() method provides a "in-depth cloning", 

The provided copy method implement a "surface cloning".(not implemented yet)
</DL>

The UTIL class provides in addition to the described methods some 
oxiliary functions used by the generated code.

<h4>How to write/read VDM values to/from the filesystem</h4>

One can use the <TT>java.io.ObjectOutputStream</TT> and the <TT>java.io.ObjectInputStream</TT> classes to save values to the filesystem and later read them back.
This is shown in the following example:

<PRE>    
    FileOutputStream ostream = new FileOutputStream("t.tmp");
    ObjectOutputStream o = new ObjectOutputStream(ostream);
    o.writeObject(Sq);
    o.writeObject(I);
    ostream.close();

    FileInputStream istream = new FileInputStream("t.tmp");
    ObjectInputStream i = new ObjectInputStream(istream);
    Sq = (Sequence)i.readObject();         // or obj = i.readObject();
    I = (Integer)i.readObject();           // or obj = i.readObject();
    istream.close();
</PRE>

<hr>
<H1><A NAME = "EH">Error Handling</A></FONT></H1>
<P>

The error handling of the VDM Java library
is based on Javas exception handling mechanism.  When an error is
detected by one of the library methods, an appropriate exception is
thrown.  This is done by instantiating an exception object with a
string describing the library method which detected the error.
All the implemented errors are subclasses of the class <tt>VDM_ERROR</tt>, 
which again is a subclass of the java.lang.Throwable class.
Other errors are catched by the java.lang.Throwable class.

<P>
<ul> 
<li> implement the copy method
<li> Set, Map, Sequence inherit from Vector. Instead, a private variable should
hide this information. This would make it impossible to use the Vector methods directly.
<li> Is the Quote implementation appropriate when we have equivalent quotes in different
VDM classes/modules?
<li> Is the token implementation appropriate?
<li> When using the iterator()
method of a Map (Set), the elements are returned in the order they have been
added to the Map (Set). This is however not the way, the VDM data type
behaves. The keys of a VDM Map (elements of a set) are enumerated according to an internal
order, independently of the order, in which the keys (elements) have been added to the map.
<li>
Improve the implementation of the VDM Union Types
<li>
Probably it would be more effective to implement the Map class as a
subclass of the java.util.Hashtable. This can be done later without
changing the interface of the Map class.
<li>
make the obj.ascii method function.....
implement the ascii method of Record when code generating, remove "mk_" from the 
UTIL.ascii method....
<li>
review private-public methods: Should it for example be allowed to use the equals methods
of the tuple directly or should we force the developer to write UTIL.equals?
</ul>
