****** The VDM-SL Toolbox Version 3.3 ******

This directory (ftp://ftp.ifad.dk/pub/toolbox/) contains current release
of the VDM-SL Toolbox.  The Toolbox runs on:
    all Sun SPARC models, under SunOS 4.1.3 or greater
    all Sun SPARC models, under Solaris 2.6 or greater
    HP 700 models, running HPUX 10.x. 
    PC/586, 686, running Windows 95 or Windows NT. 
    PC/586, 686, running Linux (not available at ftp)

The integrated tool set can be run from the command-line and with GNU
Emacs using the Emacs interface for the Toolbox, but it is highly
recommended to run it with the graphical user interface, vdmgde.

The files ending in `.gz' are packed with the GNU gzip program. You
will need the gunzip program to unpack them. You can get compiled
versions for the above architectures in the directory /pub/gzip/. 

The files ending in `.zip' are packed with the Info-ZIP program.
Information about Info-ZIP can be found at
http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/ which also has source or
executables.  You can get a compiled version for Windows 95/NT in the
directory /pub/infozip/unzipnt.exe.

If you are down-loading an evaluation copy you will
need one of the following documentation files:

The users manual describes how to install the Toolbox. 

In order to run the evaluation copy you must mail toolbox@ifad.dk for
a license file which will enable you to evaluate the Toolbox for a one
month period of your choice. An evaluation license is free, and you
must indicate in the mail for which one-month period the evaluation
license must be valid.

NPL's LaTeX and LaTeX2e macros for VDM-SL
-----------------------------------------

The vdmsl LaTeX and LaTeX2e macros distributed with the VDM-SL
Toolbox have been written at the National Physical Laboratory where
they are now being updated and maintained. Please note that you will
need a large version of TeX to use the macros in any serious way.

To obtain the macros and their documentation directly from NPL's ftp
site:
   ftp address: ftp.npl.co.uk
   Name:        anonymous
   Password:    complete e-mail address
   Directory:   /pub/latex/macros/vdm-sl

Initially we would recommend you to use the macros from this
distribution because it contains a few bug fixes which have not yet
been incorporated at the NPL site.


VDM-SL Toolbox release notes:
----------------------------------
Changes from 3.3.1 to NEXT_RELEASE
  - Pretty printing output files are now created in the current 
    working directory. Previously they were created where their
    corresponding input file was read. 
  - The Modules window now contains a hierachical view of the modules
    together with the containing files. The Files window was removed.
  - In the configure dialog the "Files in the project" now sort the file
    names. 
  - It is now possible to do 'up' and 'down' in the debugger. That is going
    to previous call stack levels and investigate the variables at that
    level.
  - It is now possible to set breakpoints on lines and columns.

Changes from 3.3 to 3.3.1

  - Testcoverage files can now contain specification file names with 
    withspace characters. 
  - FLEXlm support for Linux.

  - Speed of interpreter improved, especially with dynamic type check,
  - History on command line for GUI, 
  - 'Stop interpreter' button in GUI,
  - Remove/Enable/Disable muliple breakpoints by mouse click in GUI,
  - New -w option for RTF files: Write specification parts to text file, 
  - Improved speed in GUI debugging by 
    disabling auto-computing of argument list in function trace window, 
  - Empty 'definitions' blocks are now syntax correct. 
  - Standard math library available in interpreter,
  - If a file is changed on the file system, the status symbol for
    syntax checking is shown in reverse video,
  - Alphabetic listing of modules in GUI, 
  - Language support for import/export of polymorphic functions, 
  - GUI upgraded to Tcl/Tk version 8,
  - Visual C++ compiler on NT upgraded to version 6.0

  - Bug fixes: #309, #310.
  - Fixed bug with option -o <file> : sequence of results.

Changes from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0
  - The functions CGReadTagMap, DLReadNameMap, VDMSetTagMap and VDMTagDump
    has been removed from cg_aux.h. They are no longer needed since
    the Code Generator now generates the appropriate SetSymTag method
    calls.
  - VDM C++ Library: Trying to create Records with the same tag and
    two different sizes results in an error. 
  - The number of displayed syntax errors is limited to 100. 

  - Following bugs have been corrected: #292, #296, #035

  - The Toolbox has been ported to the DEC Alpha OSF1 v4.0d platform.
    The code generator supports the Dec cxx 6.0-021 compiler.

  - Memory leak in syntax checker fixed.

  - The char type of VDM-SL has been extended with several signs,
    e.g. line-feed. See the language manual.

  - Code generator improved such that corresponding C++ types are generated 
    for each type in the specification. Interfacing the generated code
    has been improved, e.g. it is now possible to implement by hand selected
    functions.

  - NT: Toolbox can now parse and pretty print Word RTF files.

  - The content of the project file has been changed. The configuration of 
    of the project is now only saved, and not the status (that is, if it has
    been type checked, code generated or pretty printed). The speed of reading
    the project file has been improved.

  - The dynamic link interface has been changed. See the user manual for 
    dynamica link.

  - The (pos) Type Checker has been improved to check all branches of 
    if- and case- expression/statements to be well-formed instead of  
    just one branch to be well-formed. 

  - On the Windows platform the code generator will write file names with
    a default .cpp suffix.
    On all platforms the suffix can be changed by setting the VDMCGEXT
    environment variable.

  - Expansion of collapsed function arguments in the Function Trace window
    has been moved from middle button to button 1 for better Windows
    support.

  - The Project handling has been improved. Save and Save As menus
    have been added and the New menu changed to just create a new
    empty project. 

  - Syntax error messages has been tidied up.

  - Messages from invoking the script command now appear in the
    Dialog window instead of the Log window.

  - Interpreter: When a run-time error occurs the function call stack
    is shown in the function trace window.

------------------------
  - Release 3.1.1 is a Win32-only release that contains a working Code 
    Generator for the win32 platform. 
  - The (pos) Type Checker has been improved to check all branches of 
    if- and case- expression/statements to be well-formed instead of  
    just one branch to be well-formed. 
  - On the Windows platform the code generator will write file names with
    a default .cpp suffix.
    On all platforms the suffix can be changed by setting the VDMCGEXT
    environment variable.

  - Expansion of collapsed function arguments in the Function Trace window
    has been moved from middle button to button 1 for better Windows
    support.

  - The Project handling has been improved. Save and Save As menus
    have been added and the New menu changed to just create a new
    empty project.

        #292

  - Messages from invoking the script command now appear in the
    Dialog window instead of the Log window.

  - Interpreter: When a run-time error occurs the function call stack
    is shown in the function trace window.


Changes from 3.0.1 to 3.1.0
---------------------------
  - The following bug reports have been resolved:
        #285, #272, #274, #269, #271, #276, #288

  - Improvement on the code generator:
        - pattern match generation has been improved.
        - less use of temporary variables.
        - state designators are now fully supported.
        - sequence modify is now supported.
        - map inverse is now supported.
        - improved strategy for generation of comprehension expressions.

  - The User Manual for the VDM-SL Toolbox has been improved. 

  - DOS files can now be parsed by the Unix versions of the Toolbox. 

  - The interface to the VDM library (libvdm.a) was changed by to use
    the class string (#include <string.h>) instead of class String 
    (#include <String.h>). 

  - The initialisation of values have been improved in the interpreter.

  - The test coverage tool have been updated to compute a number in
    percent identifying how big a part of functions, operations 
    and the entire specification has been covered by a test suite file.

  - The setting of the environment variables TCL_LIBRARY, TK_LIBRARY,
    ITCL_LIBRARY, ITK_LIBRARY, TIX_LIBRARY and IWIDGETS_LIBRARY has been
    replaced by the environment variabel VDMSLROOT which should be set to
    the path of the installation directory. 

Changes from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1
---------------------------
  - The following bug reports have been resolved:
    #5, #57, #84, #85, #86, #87, #88, #89, #230, #236, #241, #248, #255, 
    #259, #258,

  - An index has been introduced in the User Manual for the VDM-SL 
    Toolbox.

  - Code Generator: The numbering system for the temporary variables have
    been changed such that the numbering system is local for each generated 
    function.

  - GUI: An "Add to project" and "Remove from project" botton has been introduced
    in the project configure menu.

  - Bug 230 has been solved: Syntax errors on the command like were
    not properly handled. Now any syntax errors on the command line
    are output all at once without changing the errors from the last
    parse or type check. 

  - Bug 241 has been solved: The "quit" command didn't work in the 
    Interpreter/Dialog window.  Now the "quit" command works without
    confirmation (just like "cquit" which still exists for
    compatibility).

  - Now the setting of the TEX option is ignored and a file is parsed 
    according to it contents. If it contains any \begin{vdm_al} 
    sections it is assumed to be a file with mixed documentation 
    and specification, otherwise the file is assumed to contain only 
    specification. The syntax for \begin{vdm_al} ... \end{vdm_al} 
    has been clarified by saying that the \begin{vdm_al} and 
    \end{vdm_al} each must be preceeded by zero or more whitespace 
    characters to be taken as specification delimiters.  
    This allows one to comment out a specification section by putting, 
    e.g., a '%' in the first column of the section.

  - Now the parser allows a semicolon ';' after the last element of 
    a sequence of definitions (e.g., after the last function definition). 
    This applies to all syntactic constructs where semicolon is used as 
    a separator. 

  - Bug fixed: When selecting "Configure" twice in a row in the GUI a
    TCL/TK error would occur the second time.

  - Problem with parsing of \begin{rtinfo} section fixed.  

  - When pretty printing with index of uses, function and type
    names are put into the index with the unqualified names.
    Also a bug in the index generation has been partly fixed, where
    a name in an apply expression is assumed to be a function
    name if it is qualified and is subsequently put in the index
    (it could be a map value from another module). Previously only
    uses of functions in the same module would have been indexed. 

  - The GUI now updates the modules state indicators while
    parsing/type check/code generation/pretty printing progresses on
    multiple files/modules. 

  - The VDM C++ library can output Records with symbolic tag names when a 
    map from the numeric tags to symbolic tags has been installed with
    the function VDMSetTagMap. 

  - The Code Generator library libCG.a, has new functions that can read
    a tag repository file and return a map suitable as parameter to
    VDMSetTagMap (VDM C++ library) and NameMap (DL modules)

  - A number of problems with the dynamic type checker have been
    fixed. Further error messages have been improved when running the 
    dynamic type checker.

  - Field reference state designators (i.e. a.i := expr) is now
    supported by the VDM-SLtoC++ Code Generator
