The VDM-SL Toolbox Lite: 
----------------------------- 

The VDM-SL Toolbox Lite is a limited version of the full 
VDM-SL Toolbox Lite. The Lite Toolbox supports only a subset of the
VDM-SL language and a restricted size of specifications. The tools
supported are:
        * a syntax checker
        * a type checker
        * an interpreter and debugger.

Furthermore, the full VDM-SL Toolbox currently supports:

        * a code generator, that generates C++ code from your specification.
        * a pretty printer, that makes it possible for you to generate
          documentation from your specification in LaTeX and RTF format.
        * dynamic link feature, that makes it possible to execute 
          specification and external C++ code.
        * test coverage and statistics tools, gives you the possibility to
          assess the quality of your test cases in a test environment.
        * an extended type checker that statically can detect possible 
          run-time errors.
