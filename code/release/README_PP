NPL's LaTeX and LaTeX2e macros for VDM-SL
-----------------------------------------

The vdmsl LaTeX2e macros distributed with the VDM++
Toolbox have been written at the National Physical Laboratory where
they are now being updated and maintained. Please note that you will
need a large version of TeX to use the macros in any serious way.

To obtain the macros and their documentation directly from NPL's ftp
site:
   ftp address: ftp.npl.co.uk
   Name:        anonymous
   Password:    complete e-mail address
   Directory:   /pub/latex/macros/vdm-sl

Initially we would recommend you to use the macros from this
distribution because it contains a few bug fixes which have not yet
been incorporated at the NPL site.


VDM++ Toolbox release notes:

Changes from 6.3.a to NEXT_RELEASE

Changes from 6.0.0 to 6.1.0
---------------------------
  - The functions CGReadTagMap, DLReadNameMap, VDMSetTagMap and VDMTagDump
    has been removed from cg_aux.h. They are no longer needed since
    the Code Generator now generates the appropriate SetSymTag method
    calls.
  - VDM C++ Library: Trying to create Records with the same tag and
    two different sizes results in an error. 
  - The number of displayed syntax errors is limited to 100. 

  - Following bugs have been corrected: #292, #296, #035, #235, #219, #237, 
    #238, #260

  - The Toolbox has been ported to the DEC Alpha OSF1 v4.0d platform.
    The code generator supports the Dec cxx 6.0-021 compiler.

  - Memory leak in syntax checker fixed.

  - The char type of VDM-SL has been extended with several signs,
    e.g. line-feed. See the language manual.

  - Code generator improved such that corresponding C++ types are generated 
    for each type in the specification. Interfacing the generated code
    has been improved, e.g. it is now possible to implement by hand selected
    functions.

  - NT: Toolbox can now parse and pretty print Word RTF files.

  - The content of the project file has been changed. The configuration of 
    of the project is now only saved, and not the status (that is, if it has
    been type checked, code generated or pretty printed). The speed of reading
    the project file has been improved.

  - The (pos) Type Checker has been improved to check all branches of 
    if- and case- expression/statements to be well-formed instead of  
    just one branch to be well-formed. 

  - On the Windows platform the code generator will write file names with
    a default .cpp suffix.
    On all platforms the suffix can be changed by setting the VDMCGEXT
    environment variable.

  - Expansion of collapsed function arguments in the Function Trace window
    has been moved from middle button to button 1 for better Windows
    support.

  - The Project handling has been improved. Save and Save As menus
    have been added and the New menu changed to just create a new
    empty project. 

  - Syntax error messages has been tidied up.

  - Messages from invoking the script command now appear in the
    Dialog window instead of the Log window.

  - Interpreter: When a run-time error occurs the function call stack
    is shown in the function trace window.

Changes from 5.4 to 6.0
-----------------------

  - Following bugs have been fixed:
        #285, #172, #203

  - The coupling module between OMT and VDM++ is not supported in this version,
    but is expected to supported in version 6.1

  - The Toolbox now supports test coverage collection.

  - The Toolbox provides now an interpreter and debugger for the object 
    oriented parts of the language.

  - A new graphical interface. 

  - A specification manager is included. The specification manager gives
    an overview of the status of the specifications that are spread out in
    several files. 

  - Improvement on the code generator:
        - pattern match generation has been improved.
        - less use of temporary variables.
        - state designators are now fully supported.
        - sequence modify is now supported.
        - map inverse is now supported.
        - improved strategy for generation of comprehension expressions.

  - The interface to the VDM library (libvdm.a) was changed by to use
    the class string (#include <string.h>) instead of class String 
    (#include <String.h>). 


  - DOS files can now be parsed by the Unix versions of the Toolbox. 

  - The User Manual for the VDM++ Toolbox has been improved.
 
  - The setting of the environment variables TCL_LIBRARY, TK_LIBRARY,
    ITCL_LIBRARY, ITK_LIBRARY, TIX_LIBRARY and IWIDGETS_LIBRARY has been
    replaced by the environment variabel VDMPPROOT which should be set to
    the path of the installation directory. 

Changes from 5.3 to 5.4
-----------------------
  - The type checker has been improved for a number of constructs and 
    some bugs has been fixed.

  - vdmsl.sty version 1.1.31 is replaced by vdmsl-2e.sty version 1.1.35 
    for LaTeX2e. 

  - vpp.sty and tex.lay are updated to support LaTeX2e and version 
    1.1.35 of vdmsl-2e.sty. The new version of the pretty printer 
    (tex.lay) is not compatible with vdmsl.sty version 1.1.31.

  - A list of known bugs is now available as part of the distribution.

  - Now the parser allows a semicolon ';' after the last element of 
    a sequence of definitions (e.g., after the last function definition). 
    This applies to all syntactic constructs where semicolon is used as 
    a separator. 

  - The VDM C++ library has been optimised and it has resulted
    in speedup in most parts of the Toolbox. Additionally the type
    checker and parser has also been optimised. The type checker is
    roughly about 30 times faster and the parser is now roughly about
    2 times faster. 

  - The VDM C++ library can output Records with symbolic tag names when a 
    map from the numeric tags to symbolic tags has been installed with
    the function VDMSetTagMap. 

  - The header of files generated by the VDM-SLtoC++ code generator
    now includes a comment about the used tool version and the date
    the file was generated.

  - The VDM++toC++ Code Generator is updated to support GNU C++ 
    version 2.7.2. Furthermore, it has been improved for a number of 
    constructs and some bugs have been fixed. The most important bug
    fixes are:
      - A problem with memory leak is fixed.
      - Constructors and some include directives are moved into the
        .cc files. This implies that a problem with binary
        associations between classes is solved.
      - A problem with virtual method invocations in the generated
        code is fixed. This has been done by removing the void
        pointers entirely from the generated code. A new class
        ObjectRef has been added to the VDM++ library and a dynamic
        cast mechanism is now generated by the code generator.

  - New examples are new evailable in the dirsctory Examples.

Changes from 5.2.1 to 5.3
-------------------------
  - The error messages from the type checker has been improved.
  - Error messages are no longer merged into the source files,
    but shown in a seperate error window.
  - The syntax checker has been dramatically improved with respect to 
    error messages and recovery.
  - The type checker has been improved for a number of constructs and 
    some bugs has been fixed.
  - The Toolbox in general has been updated with respect to the VDM++
    Language Reference Manual version 11.

Changes from 5.2 to 5.2.1
-------------------------
  - The pretty printer (ast2pp) can now handle multiple AST's in one go.
  - The number of lines generated by the C++ code generator has been 
    reduced with approximately 50% in average.


Changes from 5.1 to 5.2
-----------------------
  - First official release.
  - The OSF/Motif-oriented interface, zvpp, has been exchanged with a
    Motif-alike interface, vppde.
  - The VDM++ Toolbox no longer require Motif.  
  - Now available for Sun SPARC running Solaris 2.3 or SunOS 4.1.x
    and HP-700 running HPUX 9.0.x
  - A number of bugs are fixed in the code generator.
  - Warnings and errors form the code generator are now reported through
    the user interface.
