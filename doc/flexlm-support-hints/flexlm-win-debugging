Our first step should be to get the license server running
correctly. 

Then I have to ask you to answer these questions that assume you are
running windows on your license server.

  1. What operating system and version are you using 
     (Window 4.0/2000 and service pack level, 

  2. Check that the hostname in the license file is modified to the
     correct one. If it wasn't please correct it and stop and start
     the license daemon again. You can see the expected name in the 
     c:\flexlm\Debug.log.

  3. Send me the license file you use. 

  4. send me a screendump of the Setup tab of FLEXlm License Manager
     (Alt PrintScreen saves the window to the clipboard which you can
     then paste into the Paint program and then save it to a file).

  5. send me the output of c:\flexlm\Debug.log file which is created
     after lmgrd has been Startet in the Control tab. If there is no 
     Debug.log file please check the paths in the Setup tab. 

  6. Press the Stop and Start button in the Control tab
     and then press the Status button and tell me what it reports. 

  7. open a Command Prompt window and enter
     c:
     cd flexlm
     lmutil lmstat -a >lmstat.log
     
     And send me the lmstat.log file

Thanks
