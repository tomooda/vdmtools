\item[Semantics of Operators:] \mbox{}

\begin{TypeSemantics}
Head & yields the first element of {\tt l}. {\tt
l} must be a non-empty sequence. \\ \hline

Tail & yields the subsequence of {\tt l} where the first element is
removed. {\tt l} must be a non-empty sequence.\\ \hline

Length & yields the length of {\tt l}. \\ \hline

Elements & yields the set containing all the elements of {\tt l}. \\ \hline

Indexes & yields the set of indexes of {\tt l}, i.e.\ the set \mbox{\tt
\{1,...,len l\}}. \\ \hline

Concatenation & yields the concatenation of {\tt l1} and {\tt l2},
i.e.\ the sequence consisting of the elements of {\tt l1} followed by
those of {\tt l2}, in order. \\ \hline

Distributed concatenation & yields the sequence where the elements
(these are sequences themselves) of {\tt ll} are concatenated: the
first and the second, and then the third, etc. \\ \hline

Sequence modification & the elements of {\tt l} whose indexes are in the
domain of {\tt m} are modified to the range value that the index maps
into. {\tt dom m} must be a subset of inds {\tt l} \\ \hline

Sequence application & yields the element of index from {\tt l}. {\tt
i} must be in the indexes of {\tt l}. \\ \hline
