\subsection{Increased support for analysis of deadlocks}

Whenever a deadlock is reached in VDMTools, it can be hard for a
user to determine what the cause of the deadlock is. Thus, the suggestion
is to enable the user to inspect the state of the interpreter in this
situation in a more convenient way. This could for example include:

\begin{itemize}
\item The ability to evaluate / debug the guards (synchronisation
predicates) for the different selected operations that are active in
that context
\item Inspect the value of the history counters for the different
operations in an easy manner
\item The ability to inquire the status of the interpreter scheduler
and all tasks
\end{itemize}
