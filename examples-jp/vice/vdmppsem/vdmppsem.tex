\begin{abstract}
Currently, this is very much a working document, collecting thoughts and ideas.
The aim is to write a technical report and derive a paper from the technical report.
Publication target is FM'06 (\textit{http://fm06.mcmaster.ca}), submission date is
24 February 2006.

\section{The ``Grand Idea''}

\fbox{\parbox{0.9\columnwidth}{Here a list of thoughts and ideas that would probably take 50 years of research
to complete. Obviously we need to scale down the ambition level but I personally
like to reason from the ``big picture'' first, to get the story straight.}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use Ed Lee's IEEE Computer column \cite{Lee05} to introduce the problem
of embedded software development.
\item Introduce notion of system engineering and (lack) of inter discipline
communication in practice.
\item Our grand idea: deliver a solution for engineering of embedded systems from
UML model to code and across all involved disciplines. Many partial solutions
exist already, this work should provide the ``super glue'' to stick everything
together.
\item Primary idea is to provide a suitable notation for specifying timing
properties of software. In our opinion, it's the core part that's missing.
\item The notation shall be easy to use and understand by software engineers
working in an industrial environment.
\item Break the typical abstraction barriers that make practical analysis
difficult, introduce the notion of ``deployment'', ``scheduling'' and
``communication'' at the model level.
\item Use VDM++ notation as a starting point. Extend the semantics to include
proper notion of time, preferably an operational semantics.
\item Show that useful analysis can still be performed (actually: can
\textbf{only} be performed if you do it like this) although we have broken
typical abstraction barriers.
\item Explore possibility to extract models from the VDM++ specification to
do exhaustive analysis (using model checkers or proof tools).
\item Explore possibility to integrate models with typical control engineering
simulators to explore dynamic system properties by simulation. Likely
candidates are Ptolemy (which includes Giotto), TrueTime (which is based
on Matlab/Simulink).
\item Explore how the model can be used as a basis for synthesis (e.g. code
generation).
\item buzzword compliance: model driven architecture, model based engineering.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Inventory of related work}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Parallel Object-Oriented Specification Language
(\textit{http://www.es.ele.tue.nl/poosl/}). They already go a long,
long way. Why do we need VDM++ still? Is VDM++ closer to the notations
currently used by software engineers?
\item Giotto (\textit{http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/$\sim$\/fresco/giotto/}).
\item Kopetz work on the Time-Triggered Architecture (\textit{http://www.ttagroup.org}).
\item For analysis of timed systems, UPPAAL (\textit{http://www.uppaal.com}) and
for analysis of scheduling problems (of uni-processor systems), TIMESTOOL
(\textit{http://www.timestool.org}). But there are many, many more.
\item Work performed at M\"{a}lardalen University in Sweden (see ISOLA proceedings
and their web site \textit{http://www.mrtc.mdh.se/}).
\item Ptolemy, (\textit{http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/}).
\item OMEGA, (\textit{http://www-omega.imag.fr/}) and in particular the
recent papers co-authored by Jozef (obviously :-).
\item The survey paper by Wang~\cite{Wang04} gives an extensive
overview of languages for specifying and analysis of timed systems.
\item The recent work by Lamport, ``Real-time is Really Simple''
(see \textit{http://www.lamport.org}).
\item The work on TrueTime at KTH's control engineering laboratory (see the web site
of Dan Hendrikssen at \textit{http://www.control.lth.se/$\sim$\/dan/truetime/}).
\item The work performed by Laci Posta and Natalya Mulyar at ESI,
integrating Matlab/Simulink with Rational Rose Real-Time.
\item Obviously there is the work of Mok on \textit{Real-time Logic} and the
work of Hansen and Chaochen on \textit{Duration Calculus}. A nice overview is
actually provided in \cite{Mukherjee&00}.
\item Do not forget: architecture definition languages such as Koala
(Philips), AADL (SEI, see \textit{http://www.aadl.info/}) and so on
(i.e. Garlan stuff from the Urbino summerschool).
\item I have the feeling that I've barely scratched the surface!
\end{enumerate}

\section{Notes from the brainstorm session with Evert}

\fbox{\parbox{0.9\columnwidth}{The following list was composed after
a brainstorm meeting with Evert (who is not a VDM++ expert, neither does
he have practical experience with VDMTools). So, many things are already
available in some form or other.}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The semantics of the specification language should be close to
(or mapped onto) the semantics of industry accepted implementation 
languages and operating systems, such as for example C, C++ and VxWorks.
\item Support for multi-CPU systems development where the CPU's are
interconnected through a communication bus, such as CAN, TCP/IP etcetera.
\item Estimation of the CPU time of a language construct directly from
the complexity of the statement.
\item The specification language shall be able to specify deadlines
\item The tools shall be able to determine whether these deadlines can
be met and if not, under which circumstances.
\item Support for round-robin and priority based preemptive scheduling.
\item Support analysis of deadlock, livelock, starvation, race conditions
\item Support analysis of schedulability
\item Dealing with uncertainty (probabilistic behavior, specify jitter
as a probabilistic variable?)
\item Checking of constraints and invariants
\item Integration with continuous time simulation. Bridge the discrete
event / continuous time hurdle
\item Good visualization possibilities, such as sequence diagrams
and Gantt charts, preferably in parallel with the continuous variables.
\end{enumerate}

\section{A few observations of my own}

\fbox{\parbox{0.9\columnwidth}{Here are few observations that should be
seen in addition to the ``On the Use of VDM++ for Specifying Real-time
Systems'' paper.}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Primary concern is to extend the semantics and the interpreter
to deal with multi-processing. So not only pseudo-parallel execution,
but also truly parallel execution of tasks. This is needed, for example,
to specify the behavior of the environment independently from the system.
This is an absolute must for embedded systems.
\item It shall then be possible to reason about deployment, which
active object is executed on what computing resource. Obviously, the
scheduling parameters of this computing resource should be specified,
not as a simulation parameter as it is now, but as a property of the
computation resource.
\item The notion of interrupts needs to be integrated into the language;
these concepts are common in embedded systems, but are seldom supported
at the language level. I believe that much can be gained here.
\item Similarly, it shall be possible to explicitly specify the
hardware/software interface, in particular interfaces to communication
resources (and the interconnections between the computation components,
just like in SystemC and ROOM for example, where channels are used for
that).
\item Basically, the HW/SW interface and the inner workings of the
operating system (or scheduler) should become part of the system model.
Only then can we reason about timing, response times etc at the system
level. Interestingly, Lamport provides these kinds of definitions in
his TLA+ book...
\item Simulation is the main modus operandi of the current VDMTools
implementation and I think we should keep that intact, including the
round-trip engineering philosophy (going from VDM++ to UML and back).
Maybe we should consider SysML?
\item We should consider integrating with other simulation platforms
rather than improving the VDMTools interpreter. Similarly, figure out
whether we can derive abstract specifications from our more detailed
models that can be fed into powerful analysis tools such as Uppaal,
Times, SMV and so on.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ideas for case studies}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The trip sensor specification from the ``Timing Tolerances in Safety-Critical Software''
paper by Alan Wassyng et al (see FM'05 proceedings).
\item The production cell case study of Lewerentz and Lindner (see also LNCS volume 891, 1995)
\item The ``Countermeasures'' example from the VICE project (VDM++ In a Constraint Environment)
\item The NASA Safer backpack, which is well-published and covers all domains
\item The railway crossing used by Jinfeng Huang (from the POOSL group of Jeroen Voeten)
\item (parts of) Jan Beckers paper path simulation model, nice direct link to Boderc but
a potential publication nightmare wrt confidentiality.
\item The in-car radio navigation case study of Marcel (as described in his ISOLA/STTT paper),
also fits the general theme of Marcel's PhD thesis.
\item The ``Timed Philosophers'' example from the Overture workshop paper. Is interesting
because it already includes the notational extensions we want to investigate.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Outline work plan}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe the current semantics of VDM++ using VDM++ in an operational (executable)
style. Use \cite{Lano98} and in particular \cite{Mukherjee&00} as our starting point. Use
the current VDMTools implementation to test and prototype the operational semantics.
Visualization can be taken care of by the \textit{ShowVice} tool that I already have
build for \cite{Verhoef2005}, possibly slightly modified. The workflow is described
in Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}.
\item Extend the semantics as proposed in \cite{Verhoef2005}.
\item Take an interesting case study, describe it using the ``new'' extended semantics
\item What can we analyze better now than what we did before?
\item Can we now create simulation models directly from our semantics models?
\end{enumerate}
