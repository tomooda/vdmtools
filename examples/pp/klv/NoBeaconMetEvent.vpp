\section{The NoBeaconMetEvent Test Class}

The NoBeaconMetEvent class implements the event that an announced
TIV\_E was not met in the distance it was supposed to be located. It
provides an execute operation that returns the status of the Cab
Display and of the Emergency Break.

\begin{vdm_al}
class NoBeaconMetEvent is subclass of Event

operations 

  public
  execute : KLV ==> Test`TestResult
  execute (klv) ==
    ( klv.noBeaconMet();
      let mk_(a,e,g) = klv.getCabDisplay().getDisplay(),
          e' =  klv.getEmergencyBreak().getEmergencyBreak() in
       return mk_Test`KLVstate(mk_Test`CabDisp(a,e,g), 
                               mk_Test`EmerBreak(e')) );

end NoBeaconMetEvent
