\section{The OnBoardComp Class}

The OnBoardComp class models the onboard computer of a train. The
onboard computer is responsible for checking if the speed of the train
is an allowed speed, an alarm speed, or an emergency break speed. The
values AlarmSpeedAdd and EmergencySpeedAdd represent the addition to
the maximal speed that is allowed before the alarm or emergency break
respectively is invoked.

\begin{vdm_al}
class OnBoardComp

types

  public 
  AlarmLevel = <SpeedOk> | <AlarmSpeed> | <EmergencyBreakSpeed>;

values 

  AlarmSpeedAdd = 5;
  EmergencySpeedAdd = 10;
\end{vdm_al}

The checkSpeed functions is the only function of the OnBoard
Computer. It checks whether a speed is less than the alarm speed
(maximal speed plus AlarmSpeedAdd) and the emergency break speed
(maximal speed plus EmergencySpeedAdd).

\begin{vdm_al}
functions

  public
  checkSpeed : real * real -> AlarmLevel
  checkSpeed (speed, maxspeed) ==
    if speed < maxspeed + AlarmSpeedAdd
    then <SpeedOk>
    elseif speed < maxspeed + EmergencySpeedAdd
    then <AlarmSpeed>
    else <EmergencyBreakSpeed>

end OnBoardComp
\end{vdm_al}
