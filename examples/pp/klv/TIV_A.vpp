\section{The TIV\_A Class}

The TIV_A class represents the TIV_A beacon and implements the
abstract Beacon class. The class does not contain any instance
variables nor operations as the presence of the beacon defines the
action to perform.

\begin{vdm_al}
class TIV_A is subclass of Beacon
 
end TIV_A
\end{vdm_al}
