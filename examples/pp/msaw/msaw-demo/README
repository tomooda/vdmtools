| This directory and its subdirectories contain the material needed for the   |
| standard demonstration of Venus.                                            |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Contents of the subdirectories

	msaw-init/
		This directory contains the `starting point' for the
		demonstration, so that the initial setting can easily be
		restored each time a new demonstration is given. Initial
		settings can be installed by typing `make' or `make init'.
        msaw-spec/
                This directory contain the source files of the VDM++
                specification of the MSAW example. These source files
                are the `starting point' used by make init.
	msaw-data/
		This directory contains input data for the prototype version
		of MSAW, i.e. sample radar data for flights and information 
		on obstacles on the ground. The prototype can be started by
		typing `make prototype' using `standard' input data. Input
		data can easily be varied.
	msaw-lib/
		Data needed for various purposes.
        msaw-latex/
                LaTeX pretty print of the VDM++ specification.                
	Makefile
		All components of the demonstration can be invoked using
		`make', including installing initial settings and destroying
		the remains of a demonstration, so that within a single
		demonstration session changes can be freely made to the
		demonstration artifacts without consequences.
	README
		You are reading it.

2. Preparing for the demonstration

- Make sure that all tools are installed properly, following the 
  installation instructions carefully.

3. Running the demonstration

The initial settings of the demonstration are installed by typing
`make' or `make init'. This creates a VDM++ Toolbox class library
with the name `MSAW_Prototype.cd_lib' which can be used for the formal
specification block of the demonstration, a file `MSAW_Prototype.cd' which
contains the class diagram for the graphical modelling block and some
configuration files for `oedit'. This should be done before each individual
demonstration! After a demonstration session, the remains of the demonstration
can be destroyed by typing `make clean'.

Each individual block of the demonstration is started by typing
`make block<number>'.
