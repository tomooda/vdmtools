This directory contains the Quadrilateral example (four side figures).
This is a simple example illustrating the use of inheritance in
VDM++. Further, this example show how to write a C++ program on top of
the generated C++ code.

Content of the directory:

  - *.vpp                 The files of the Quadrilateral example.

  - Makefile              Makefile to compile the generated C++ code
                          (REMEMBER to update the TBDIR macro)
  - app.cc                C++ main program
  - *.h, *.cc             Generated code
