This file describes how to check out the specification of the 
dynamic semantics and run test suites at specification level.

Creating a working directory
----------------------------

mkdir dynsem
cd dynsem
cvs co tb-dynsem
ln -s eval-spec/Makefile
make link


Preprocessing the specification
-------------------------------

The specification is automatically preprocessed by the test
environment whenever needed. However, make PP and make SL will
preprocess VDM-SL and VDM++ versions of the specification,
respectively.

Making a complete document
--------------------------

make dynsem.dvi    # default

Running test suites at specification level
------------------------------------------

copy .vdmde-dym-sl (or .vdmde-dyn-pp) from ~cg/test into your statsem
directory. 

Edit and change your copy of .vdmde-dyn-sl.

mkdir test
cd test
~cg/test/testdir -Dy -s .. ~cg/test/CORE/expr/letexpr

dynsem.dvi:

  Generates .div file of dynamic semantic document
  For including testcoverage information in the document, a copy of
  "rtinfo.ast" must be in the working directory.

dynsem.ps:

  Generates postscript of dynamic semantic document
  For including testcoverage information in the document, a copy of
  "rtinfo.ast" must be in the working directory.

dtc_off:

  Performs preprocessing on modules of the dynamic semantic specification.
  The option "dynamic type checking" is switched off!
  Changes the extension of the modules from ".vdm" to ".vdmsl"

dtc_on:

  Performs preprocessing on modules of the dynamic semantic specification.
  The option "dynamic type checking" is switched on!
  Changes the extension of the modules from ".vdm" to ".vdmsl"
