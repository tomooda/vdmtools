To generate the specification for the VICE version of the static
semantics (i.e. with support for the duration statement) a separate
VICE directory should be made, and Makefile.VICE should be copied
to this directory as Makefile. The usual setup follows, with a link
to the ast directory, followed by "make linkall".
