Conventions for VDMTools standard libraries:

1. Specification files for VDMSL (flat and module) and VDM++ are
   generated from a single source file by a shell script,
2. Source files has extension 'src',
3. Comments starting with '-- VDM++:' are treated special:
     - For VDMSL they are completely removed,
     - For VDM++ everything after the ':' is left.
   This is used for access modifiers,
4. Class/module names are uppercase and file name is class/module
   name in lowercase.
