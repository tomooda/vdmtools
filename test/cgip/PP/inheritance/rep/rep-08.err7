Cannot be compiled with g++ v2.6.2 and v2.6.3 due to a problem with
the code generator. Consider the following inheritance scheme:

    A
   / \
  C   D
   \ /
    B

The problem is that the method SetVal is defined (virtual) in both
class A, C and D. The C++ version of class B cannot be compiled
because both SetVal in class C and D will redefine SetVal in class A.

Note: This test case works with g++ 2.5.8
