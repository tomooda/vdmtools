Test of the Java Codegenerator.
===============================

Test of the Java Options
========================
are not tested by the test environment!!


Test of the Java Multiple Inheritance
=====================================
only depend-05 makes use of a javainterfaces file
The Java CG only generates interfaces on IMPLEMENTATION level!!!!

.javaexp and .javerr files
==========================
expected results: if .javaexp exists, this result is used, otherwise .exp is used
                  .cppexp files are only for C++

expected errors: the Java Codegenerator has it's own .javaerr files. 
                 When the Java code generation result in an error 9 for example
                 and the file .javaerr9 does not exist, we will get an 
                 UNEXPECTED ERROR, though a .err9 file might exist.
