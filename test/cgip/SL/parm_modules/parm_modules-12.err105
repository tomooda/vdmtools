This is a known bug which appears because a lambda expression is used
inside a parameterised module. This can be fixed by running through the
instruction code when the module is instantiated and change the Push
instructions which contain an explicit function value produced by a 
lambda expression to the name of the new module name for the module 
(ie. replace the modName component from the name of the parameterised 
module to the name of the instantiated module).
