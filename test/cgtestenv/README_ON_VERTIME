VERTIME :
This tool works in cooperation with the dynamic semantics and Code Generator 
test environment. It takes two files as arguments. These files are produced
by the environment. The file produced is called resume.txt and contains some
informations about time. To use this files with the vertime command you first
have to use twice the test environment two create the two different files for
the two different versions.

To create the file resume.txt you have to add lines in the test-scripts of
the code generator test environment (sorry but it was an personal use). First
use the time command over the call for the interpretation of the testcase to 
assess the time spent. A redirection of that time will be made in a file referenced
by the $TIME constant. The following lines then will have to be used :
###                echo $TESTDIR/$TESTCASE `egrep "[0-9]+.[0-9]+ real[ ]+[0-9]+.[0-9]+ user[ ]+[0-9]+.[0-9]+ sys" $TIME | awk '{print $1 " : " $3 " : " $5}'` >> resume.txt

(### has to be removed)

It must be precised that of course the two files provided to the command have to reference the 
same test-cases, otherwise for some obvious reasons, the comparisons wouldn't be correct. 

Once the ouput is produced you just have to run once latex2e on result.tex.

Sorry for that ugly user interface...
